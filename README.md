# MyEthMeta - Decentralized metadata for your Ethereum account

MyEthMeta is a decentralized metadata service for Ethereum accounts. It is something like Gravatar, but here the metadata and your profile picture is assigned to your Ethereum address. We have no any backend servers, **you fully own your own data**.
