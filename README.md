# MyEthMeta - Decentralized metadata for your Ethereum account

MyEthMeta is a decentralized metadata service for Ethereum accounts. It is something like Gravatar, but here the metadata and your profile picture are assigned to your Ethereum address. We have no backend servers, **you fully own your own data**.

MyETHMeta is **MOVED TO** https://myethmeta.github.io/ and the https://github.com/MyETHMeta organization. **This repo is deprecated!**
